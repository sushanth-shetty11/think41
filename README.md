# 🌐 Browser History Tracker

A simple and clean JavaScript-based web application that tracks and displays a list of visited URLs with timestamps. Designed with a modern UI and dynamic rendering.

## ✨ Features

- 🕒 Tracks visited URLs with live timestamps
- 🔢 Automatically numbers each visited entry
- 🧹 Remove duplicates and keep only the most recent version
- ⚙️ Adjustable maximum history length
- 🌈 Modern, responsive UI with soft background and card layout
- 🔁 Clear history instantly

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Enter a URL in the input field and click "Visit".
2. The app will:
   - Add the URL to the top of the history list
   - Attach the current time to the entry
   - Remove duplicates if the URL already exists
   - Limit the list based on the selected number
3. Clear history using the "Clear History" button
